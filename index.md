I want you to start by clicking this [link](https://pyscript.net/examples/panel_stream.html).  

Wait a few seconds.  

What do you think of it ? 

It was built in a very unusual manner...

### 1. &ensp; What is Pyscript ? 

abc

* <https://pyscript.net/>
* <https://github.com/pyscript>
* <https://github.com/pyscript/pyscript/blob/main/GETTING-STARTED.md>
* [Original Anaconda Blog](https://www.anaconda.com/blog/pyscript-python-in-the-browser)




### 2. &ensp;  Cut to the chase and get to it...

Ok, it's very simple. 

`<p>This is normal text - <b>and this is bold text</b>.</p>`

HTML tags.  Yes, we are going way back.  Like the [simple stuff](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_comment.asp)

An HTML tag is a piece of markup language used to indicate the beginning and end of an HTML element in an HTML document.  Yes, got it.  

The new PyScript project lets you embed Python programs **directly** in HTML pages and execute them within the browser without any server-based requirements.

### 4. &ensp;  How do I know if my particular python library is supported ???

If you make the [list](https://github.com/pyodide/pyodide/tree/main/packages), you are supported. 

All those hours you spent learning numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, altair, and even bokeh are about to pay off...

#### How do I know if my python library is supported ? 

Go [here](https://github.com/pyodide/pyodide/tree/main/packages) - if you see it on that page, its supported...

#### How do you do things today ? 

I do this
I do that
