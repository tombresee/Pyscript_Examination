## What is NFL-Eval?

__SemEval__ is a series of international natural language processing (NLP) research workshops whose mission is to advance the current state of the art in semantic analysis and to help create high-quality annotated datasets in a range of increasingly challenging problems in natural language semantics. 
Each year's workshop features a collection of shared tasks in which computational semantic analysis systems designed by different teams are presented and compared.

SemEval is sponsored by the [SIGLEX](http://alt.qcri.org/siglex/) Special Interest Group on the Lexicon of the Association for Computational Linguistics.

Tom:  There will be new [tasks](https://tombresee.github.io/NFL/tasks.html) ranging from prediction to old link https://semeval.github.io/SemEval2021/tasks.html

The 14th edition of SemEval features 12 tasks on topics ranging from lexical semantic change to offensive language in social media.

It will take place December 12–13, 2020 <s>in Barcelona, Spain</s> online, colocated with [COLING 2020](https://coling2020.org/).

## [SemEval-2021](https://semeval.github.io/SemEval2021/)

The 15th edition of SemEval will feature [tasks](https://semeval.github.io/SemEval2021/tasks.html) ranging from prediction of lexical complexity to learning with disagreements, and including several cross-lingual and multi-modal tasks.



valuation period will take place in January 2021. See the [SemEval-2021 homepage](https://semeval.github.io/SemEval2021/) for details.

The workshop will take place August 5–6, 2021 in Bangkok, Thailand, colocated with [ACL-IJCNLP 2021](https://2021.aclweb.org/).
