I want you to start by clicking [this link](https://pyscript.net/examples/panel_stream.html).  

Wait a few seconds.  

What do you think of it ? 

It was built in a very unusual manner...




<br>

### 1. &ensp; What is Pyscript ?

* <https://github.com/pyscript>
* <https://github.com/pyscript/pyscript/blob/main/GETTING-STARTED.md>
* [Original Anaconda Blog](https://www.anaconda.com/blog/pyscript-python-in-the-browser)




<br>

### 2. &ensp;  Cut to the chase and get to it...

Ok, it's very simple. 

`<p>This is normal text - <b>and this is bold text</b>.</p>`

HTML tags.  Yes, we are going way back.  Like the [simple stuff](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_comment.asp). 

An HTML tag is a piece of markup language used to indicate the beginning and end of an HTML element in an HTML document.  Yes, got it.  

> <u>The new PyScript project lets you embed Python programs *directly* in HTML pages and execute them within the browser without any server-based requirements.</u>


<br>

**The Process:**

1. Add the stylesheet
2. Add the script .js reference
3. Just write your code as if you were in any other IDE...


<br>


```python
<html>
  <head>

    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://pyscript.net/alpha/pyscript.css" />
  
    <script defer src="https://pyscript.net/alpha/pyscript.js"></script>
  
  </head>
  <body> 
  
  <py-script> 
print('Tom is coolj') 
   </py-script> 

</body>
</html>
```





<br>

### 3. &ensp;  Just show me what you are talking about ...












<br>

### 4. &ensp;  How do I know if my particular python library is supported ???

If you make the [list](https://github.com/pyodide/pyodide/tree/main/packages), you are supported. 

All those hours you spent learning numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, altair, bokeh, scipy, **networkx**, etc are about to pay off...Even the mighty **scikit-learn is supported**.
